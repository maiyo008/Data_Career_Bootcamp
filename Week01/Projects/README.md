## About EDA
* EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis, which is a critical step in the data analysis process in data science. It involves examining and summarizing the main characteristics of the data, including its distribution, central tendency, variation, correlation, and relationships between variables.

* The primary goal of EDA is to gain an understanding of the data and identify any patterns, trends, or anomalies that may be present. This process can help data scientists to identify potential issues in the data, such as missing or incomplete data, outliers, or inconsistencies, that need to be addressed before conducting further analysis.

* EDA can involve the use of various techniques, including data visualization, summary statistics, and data cleaning, to help identify patterns and insights in the data. By performing EDA, data scientists can better understand the data and make informed decisions about how to proceed with further analysis and modeling.
